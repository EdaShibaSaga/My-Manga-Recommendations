# Anime
Shorter list (I don't really watch anime) of stuff I watched but didn't read. Also no links those explode every week or two.

### You're under arrest ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Trans-%2328bd54)

## Mobile Suit _Gundam_: The Witch from Mercury
Gundam yuri (Don't expect yuri)


# What do things mean

 - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/WBQA-%23eb5ee4): Written by queer author (That I know, if this tag isn't there it just means I didn't check).
 - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Trans-%2328bd54): Ranges from "character that looks directly at the screen and screams "I AM TRANSGENDER" to implied they are trans. (Or just trans themes)"
 - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Queer-%23edc31a): Hard to put it into a named box that is more specific
 - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Yuri-%23a11b20): Girls kissing
 - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/TW-%23211496): Be cautious reading these, they feature heavier themes
